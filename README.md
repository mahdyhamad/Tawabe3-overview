# Tawabe3 Project :art:
A platform where stores can have an e-commerce website to recieve orders releated to custom name tages. Stores are provided with an Admin platform to manage thier orders, track designers progress, and revenue.

## The Idea :bulb:
Some stores in Amman design name tages for school students, this sticker is customizable. The students can select the background, what is written on it, and how many they want. They also can add a photo of them on the sticker. This all happen on a papers, and the designs are sent to designers from different branches using Whats App. This made the whole process harder to manage when the number of orders increase. And the problem is bad hand writting which results in a bad customer service. Because the customer expects to pickup the order with no mistakes. And alot of mistaks happen when using the paper system.
